Appendix
********

This chapter includes additional configuration options and/or general systems configuration.

It is meant for more advanced usage.


Using Fully Qualified Domain Name for my server
===============================================

This requires that you have set up DNS service to point a fully qualified domain name to your server's IP address.

For example, ``x-vps.com`` points to 185.10.48.110 (if you simply ``ping x-vps.com`` you will see the IP address).

Instead of using the ports e.g. 8811 and 5555 with IP combination, we can use a FQDN, e.g. ``pm.example.com`` to reach peer manager on our server.

Note that by doing this you will not be able to re-use a let's encrypt free certificate. Unless you request a certificate per domain, or purchase a star certificate.

|


In this chapter we are going to configure nginx to serve IOTA Peer Manager and Grafana on port 443 (HTTPS), while using a fully qualified domain name.


You should be able to create subdomains for your main domain name. For example, if your FQDN is "example.com", you can create in your DNS service an entry for::

  pm.example.com

and::

  grafana.example.com


Here's what you have to change:

For Peer Manager, edit the file ``/etc/nginx/conf.d/iotapm.conf``::

  upstream iotapm {
    server 127.0.0.1:8011;
  }

  server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name pm.example.com;
    server_tokens off;

    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/ssl.cfg;

    auth_basic "Restricted";
    auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://iotapm;
    }
  }

Of course, don't forget to replace ``pm.example.com`` with your own FQDN e.g. ``pm.my-fqdn.com``.

Now, test nginx is okay with the change::

  nginx -t

Output should look like this::

  # nginx -t
  nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
  nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful

Then, reload nginx configuration::

  systemctl reload nginx

You should be able to point your browser to ``https://pm.my-fqdn.com`` and see the Peer Manager.

For **Ubuntu** you will have to allow http port in ufw firewall::

  ufw allow http


For **Centos**::

  firewall-cmd --add-service=https --permanent --zone=public && firewall-cmd --reload


The same can be done for grafana ``/etc/nginx/conf.d/grafana.conf``::

  upstream grafana {
      server 127.0.0.1:3000;
  }

  server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name grafana.example.com;
    server_tokens off;

    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/ssl.cfg;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://grafana;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
  }

Again, test nginx: ``nginx -t`` and reload nginx: ``systemctl reload nginx``.

Now you should be able to point your browser to ``https://grafana.my-fqdn.com``.


.. _revProxyWallet:

Reverse Proxy for IRI API (wallet)
==================================

If you read the two chapters above about configuring nginx to support FQDN or HTTPS you might be wondering whether you should reverse proxy from the web server to IRI API port (for wallet connections etc).

``iri-playbook`` installs HAProxy with which you can reverse proxy to IRI API port and benefit from logging and security policies. In addition, you can add a HTTPS certificate. IOTA's Trinity wallet requires nodes to have a valid SSL certificate.

See :ref:`haproxyEnable` on how to enable HAproxy for wallet via reverse proxy and how to enable HTTPS(SSL) for it.



.. _alerting:

Sending Alert Notifications
===========================

Since release v1.1 a new feature has been introduced to support alerting.

.. warning::

   This is considered an advanced feature. Configuration hereof requires some basic Linux and system configuration experience.


.. note::

  To edit files you can use ``nano`` which is a simple editor. See :ref:`usingNano` for instructions.


TL;DR version
-------------

1. Edit the file ``/opt/prometheus/alertmanager/config.yml`` using nano or any other editor.

2. Find the following lines:

.. code:: bash

   # Send using postfix local mailer
   # You can send to a gmail or hotmail address
   # but these will most probably be put into junkmail
   # unles you configure your DNS and the from address
   - name: email-me
     email_configs:
     - to: root@localhost
       from: alertmanager@test001
       html: '{{ template "email.tmpl" . }}'
       smarthost: localhost:25
       send_resolved: true


3. Replace the email address in the line: ``- to: root@localhost`` with your email address.

4. Replace the email address in the line ``from: alertmanager@test001`` with your node's name, e.g: ``alertmanager@fullnode01``.

5. Save the file (in nano CTRL-X and confirm 'y')

6. Restart alertmanager: ``systemctl restart alertmanager``


**Note**

Emails generated by your server will most certainly end up in junk mail. The reason being that your server is not configured as verified for sending emails.

You can, alternatively, try to send emails to your gmail account if you have one (or any other email account).

You will find examples in the ``/opt/prometheus/alertmanager/config.yml`` on how to authenticate.



For more information about alertmanager's configuration consult the `documentation <https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/#email_config>`_.


Configuration
-------------

The monitoring system has a set of default alerting rules. These are configured to monitor various data of the full node.

|

For example:

* CPU load high
* Memory usage high
* Swap usage high
* Disk space low
* Too few or too many neighbors
* Inactive neighbors
* Milestones sync

**Prometheus** is the service responsible for collecting metrics data from the node's services and status.

**Alert Manager** is the service responsible for sending out notifications.



Configuration Files
-------------------
It is possible to add or tweak existing rules:


Alerts
^^^^^^
The alerting rules are part of Prometheus and are configured in ``/etc/prometheus/alert.rules.yml``.

.. note::

   Changes to Prometheus's configuration requires a restart of prometheus.


Notifications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The configuration file for alertmanager can be found in ``/opt/prometheus/alertmanager/config.yml``.

This is where you can **set your email address and/or slack channel** (not from iota!) to where you want to send the notifications.

The email template used for the emails can be found in ``/opt/prometheus/alertmanager/template/email.tmpl``.


.. note::

   Changes to Alert Manager configuration files require a restart of alertmanager.


Controls
--------
Prometheus can be controlled via systemctl, for example:

.. code:: bash

   To restart: systemctl restart prometheus
   To stop: systemctl stop prometheus
   Status: systemctl status prometheus
   Log: journalctl -u prometheus

The same can be done with ``alertmanager``.


For more information see `Documentation Prometheus Alertmanager <https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/>`_



Restart IRI On Latest Subtangle Milestone Stuck
===============================================

A trigger to restart IRI restart when the Latest Subtangle Milestone Stuck is stuck has been added to alertmanager.

If you don't have alert manager or had it installed before this feature was introduced, see :ref:`upgradeToFeature`.


.. warning::

   This feature is disabled by default as this is not considered a permanent or ideal solution. Please, first try to download a fully sycned database as proposed in the faq, or try to find "healthier" neighbors.


Enabling the Feature
--------------------

Log in to your node and edit the alertmanager configuration file: ``/opt/prometheus/alertmanager/config.yml``.

You will find the following lines::

  # routes:
  # - receiver: 'executor'
  #  match:
  #    alertname: MileStoneNoIncrease

Remove the ``#`` comments, resulting in::

  routes:
  - receiver: 'executor'
    match:
     alertname: MileStoneNoIncrease

Try not to mess up the indentation (should be 2 spaces to begin with).

After having applied the changes, save the file and restart alertmanager: ``systemctl restart alertmanager``.

What will happen next is that the service called ``prom-am-executor`` will be called and trigger a restart to IRI when the Latest Subtangle Milestone is stuck for more than ``30`` minutes.


.. note::

  This alert-trigger is set to only execute if the Latest Subtangle Milestone is stuck and not equal to the initial database milestone.


Disabling the Feature
---------------------
A quick way to disable this feature:

.. code:: bash

   systemctl stop prom-am-executor && systemctl disable prom-am-executor

To re-enable:

.. code:: bash

   systemctl enable prom-am-executor && systemctl start prom-am-executor


Configuring the Feature
-----------------------

You can choose to tweak some values for this feature, for example how long to wait on stuck milestones before restarting IRI:

Edit the file ``/etc/prometheus/alert.rules.yml``, find the alert definition::

    # If latest subtangle milestone doesn't increase for 30 minutes
    - alert: MileStoneNoIncrease
      expr: increase(iota_node_info_latest_subtangle_milestone[30m]) == 0
        and iota_node_info_latest_subtangle_milestone != 243000
      for: 1m
      labels:
        severity: critical
      annotations:
        description: 'Latest Subtangle Milestone increase is {{ $value }}'
        summary: 'Latest Subtangle Milestone not increasing'

The line that denotes the time: ``increase(iota_node_info_latest_subtangle_milestone[30m]) == 0`` -- here you can replace the ``30m`` with any other value in the same format (e.g. ``1h``, ``15m`` etc...)

If any changes to this file, remember to restart prometheus: ``systemctl restart prometheus``


.. _upgradeToFeature:

Upgrading the Playbook to Get the Feature
-----------------------------------------

If you installed the playbook before this feature was release you can still install it.

1. Enter the iri-playbook directory and pull new changes:

.. code:: bash

   cd /opt/iri-playbook && git pull

If this command breaks, it means that you have conflicting changes in one of the configuration files. See :ref:`gitConflicts` on how to apply new changes (or hit me up on Discord or github for assitance:  @nuriel77)

2. WARNING, this will overwrite changes to your monitoring configuration files if you had any manually applied! Run the playbook's monitoring role:

.. code:: bash

   ansible-playbook -i inventory -v site.yml --tags=monitoring_role -e overwrite=true

3. **If** the playbook fails with 401 authorization error (probably when trying to run prometheus grafana datasource), you will have to re-run the command and supply your web-authentication password together with the command:

.. code:: bash

   ansible-playbook -i inventory -v site.yml --tags=monitoring_role -e overwrite=true -e iotapm_nginx_password="mypassword"


.. _configMultipleSSHHost:

Configuring Multiple Nodes for Ansible
======================================

Using the Ansible playbook, it is possible to configure multiple full nodes at once.

How does it work?

Basically, following the manual installation instructions should get you there: :ref:`installation`.

This chapter includes some information on how to prepare your nodes.

Overview
--------
The idea is to clone the iri-playbook repository onto one of the servers/nodes, configure values and run the playbook.

The node from where you run the playbook will SSH connect to the rest of the nodes and configure them. Of course, it will also become a full node by itself.


SSH Access
----------
For simplicity, let's call the node from where you run the playbook the "master node".

In order for this to work, you need to have SSH access to all nodes from the master node. This guide is based on user ``root`` access. There is a possibility to run as a user with privileges and become root, but we will skip this for simplicity.


Assuming you already have SSH access to all the nodes (using password?) let's prepare SSH key authentication which allows you to connect without having to enter a password each time.

Make sure you are root ``whoami``. If not, run ``sudo su -`` to become root.

Create New SSH Key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let's create a new SSH key:

.. code:: bash

  ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa

You will be asked to enter the path (allow the default ``/root/.ssh/id_rsa``) and password (for simplicity, just click 'Enter' to use no password).

Output should look similar to this::

  # ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa
  Generating public/private rsa key pair.
  Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
  Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
  Enter same passphrase again:
  Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
  Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
  The key fingerprint is:
  SHA256:tCmiLASAsDLPAhH3hcI0s0TKDCXg/QwQukVQZCHL3Ok root@test001
  The key's randomart image is:
  +---[RSA 2048]----+
  |#%/. ..          |
  |@%*=o.           |
  |X*o*.   .        |
  |+*. +  . o       |
  |o.oE.o. S        |
  |.o . . .         |
  |. o              |
  | .               |
  |                 |
  +----[SHA256]-----+

The generated key is the default key to be used by SSH when authenticating to other nodes (``/root/.ssh/id_rsa``).


Copy SSH Key Identity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Next, we copy the public key to the other nodes:

.. code:: bash

  ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa root@other-node-name-or-ip

Given that you have root SSH access to the other nodes, you will be asked to enter a password, and possibly a question about host authenticity.

Output should look like::

  # ssh-copy-id root@other-node-name-or-ip
  /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
  The authenticity of host 'node-name (10.10.1.1)' can't be established.
  ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:4QAhCxldhxR2bWes4uSVGl7ZAKiVXqgNT7geWAS043M.
  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
  /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
  /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
  root@other-node-name-or-ip's password:

  Number of key(s) added: 1

  Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'root@other-node-name-or-ip'"
  and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

Perform the authentication test, e.g ``ssh 'root@other-node-name-or-ip'``. This should work without a password.


Run the ``ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/id_rsa root@other-node-name-or-ip`` for each node you want to configure.


Once this is done you can use Ansible to configure these nodes.


.. _usingNano:

Using Nano to Edit Files
========================

Nano is a linux editor with which you can easily edit files. Of course, this is nothing like a graphical editor (e.g. notepad) but it does its job.

Most Linux experts use ``vi`` or ``vim`` which is much harder for beginners.

First, ensure you have ``nano`` installed:

* On **Ubuntu**: ``apt-get install nano -y``
* On **CentOS**: ``yum install nano -y``

Next, you can use nano to create a new file or edit an existing one. For example, we want to create a new file ``/tmp/test.txt``, we run:

.. code:: bash

  nano /tmp/test.txt

Nano opens the file and we can start writing. Let's add the following lines::

  IRI_NEIGHBORS="tcp://just-testing.com:13000 udp://testing:15600"

Instead of writing this, you can copy paste it. Pasting can be done using right mouse click or **SHIFT-INSERT**.

To save the file you can click **F3** or, to exit and save you can click **CTRL-X**, if any modifications it will ask you if to save the file.


After having saved the file, you can run ``nano /tmp/test.txt`` again in order to edit the existing file.


.. note::

  Please check `Nano's Turorial <https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/42980/the-beginners-guide-to-nano-the-linux-command-line-text-editor/>`_ for more information.

.. _haproxyEnable:

Running IRI API Port Behind HAProxy
===================================

The IRI API port can be configured to be accessible via HAProxy. The benefits in doing so are:

- Logging
- Whitelist/blacklisting
- Password protection
- Rate limiting per IP, or per command
- Denying invalid requests

To get it configured and installed you can use ``iric`` or run::

  cd /opt/iri-playbook && git pull && ansible-playbook -i inventory -v site.yml --tags=iri_ssl,loadbalancer_role -e lb_bind_address=0.0.0.0 -e overwrite=yes


Please read this **important information**:

The API port will be accessible on **14267** by default.

**Note** that if you have previously enabled IRI with ``--remote`` option or ``API_HOST = 0.0.0.0`` you can disable those now. HAProxy will take care of that.

In addition, the **REMOTE_LIMIT_API** in the configuration files are no longer playing any role. HAProxy has taken control over the limited commands.

To see the configured denied/limited commands see ``group_vars/all/lb.yml`` or edit ``/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`` after installation. The regex is different from what you have been used to.


.. _rateLimits:

Rate Limits
-----------

HAProxy enables rate limiting. In some cases, if you are loading a seed which has a lot of transactions on it, HAProxy might block too many requests.

One solution is to increase the rate limiting values in ``/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg``. Find those lines and set the number accordingly:

.. code:: bash

  # dynamic stuff for frontend + raise gpc0 counter
  tcp-request content  track-sc2 src
  acl conn_rate_abuse  sc2_conn_rate gt 250
  acl http_rate_abuse  sc2_http_req_rate gt 400
  acl conn_cur_abuse  sc2_conn_cur gt 21


Don't forget to restart HAProxy afterwards: ``systemctl restart haproxy``.



.. _enableHTTPSHaproxy:

Enabling HTTPS for HAProxy
--------------------------

To enable HTTPS for haproxy find the option in the main menu of ``iric``. It will enable HAProxy to serve the IRI API on port 14267 with HTTPS (Warning: this will override any manual changes you might have applied to ``/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg`` previously).

The option will also allow you to configure all the services served via nginx to use the certificate (Grafana, IOTA Peer Manager etc)


.. note::

  If you previously used a script to configure Let's Encrypt with Nginx and your Nginx is no longer working, please follow the instructions at :ref:`fixNginx`

.. _options:

Installation Options
====================

This is an explanation about the select-options provided by the fully automated installer.

Nelson
------
Nelson is a software which enabled auto-peering for IRI (finding neighbors automatically).

If Nelson is not used, neighbors have to be manually maintained (default).

You can read more about it `here <https://github.com/SemkoDev/nelson.cli>`_.

HAproxy
-------
HAProxy is a proxy/load-balancer. In the context of this installation it can be enabled to serve the IRI API port.

You can read more about it here: :ref:`haproxyEnable`.

Monitoring
----------
The monitoring refers to installation of:

- Prometheus (metrics collector)
- Alertmanager (trigger alerts based on certain rules)
- Grafana (Metrics dashboard)
- Iota-prom-exporter (IRI full node metrics exporter for Prometheus)

It is recommended to install those to have a full overview of your node's performance.

ZMQ Metrics
-----------
IRI can provide internal metrics and data by exposing ZeroMQ port (locally by default). If enabled, this will allow the iota-prom-exporter to read this data and create additional graphs in Grafana (e.g. transactions confirmation rate etc).


.. _upgradeIri:

Upgrade IRI and Remove Existing Database
========================================

(option #3 from the `IOTA Snapshot Blog <https://blog.iota.org/the-april-29-2018-iota-snapshot-and-iri-1-4-2-4-behind-the-scenes-7e034babcd44>`_)

A snapshot of the database normally involves a new version of IRI. This is also the case in the upcoming snapshot of April 29th, 2018.

Here are the steps you should follow in order to get a new version of IRI and remove the old database:

Run the following commands as user ``root`` (you can run ``sudo su`` to become user root).

1. Stop IRI:

.. code:: bash

  systemctl stop iri

2. Remove the existing database:

.. code:: bash

  rm -rf /var/lib/iri/target/mainnet*

3. Run ``iric`` the command-line utility. Choose "Update IRI Software". This will download the latest version and restart IRI.

If you don't have ``iric`` installed, you can refer to this chapter on how to upgrade IRI manually :ref:`upgradeIri`.


.. _upgradeIriKeepDB:

Upgrade IRI and Keep Existing Database
======================================

(option #2 from the `IOTA Snapshot Blog <https://blog.iota.org/the-april-29-2018-iota-snapshot-and-iri-1-4-2-4-behind-the-scenes-7e034babcd44>`_)

If you want to keep the existing database, the instructions provided by the IF include steps to compile the RC version (v1.4.2.4_RC) and apply a database migration tool.


To make this process easy, I included a script that will automate this process. This script works for both CentOS and Ubuntu (but **only** for ``iri-playbook`` installations).

You will be asked if you want to download a pre-compiled IRI from my server, or compile it on your server should you choose to do so.


Please read the warning below and use the following command (as root) in order to upgrade to 1.4.2.4_RC and keep the existing database:

.. code:: bash

  bash <(curl -s https://x-vps.com/get_iri_rc.sh)


.. warning::

  This script will only work with installations of the iri-playbook.
  I provide this script to assist, but I do not take any responsibility for any damages, loss of data or breakage.
  By running this command you agree to the above and you take full responsibility.


For assistance and questions you can find help on IOTA's #fullnodes channel (discord).

Upgrade IRI to the Local Snapshot Version
=========================================

At time of writing the database has grown to 51GB+ (compressed). It becomes harder to share the database copy with node operators.

I decided to help iri-playbook users to upgrade their nodes to the ``1.6.0-RC12`` version of IRI. (note that it **is not** an official release).

This will allow nodes with smaller HDD space to keep their nodes up and running.

Please run the following command (become root) to get and run the upgrade script:

.. code:: bash

  bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuriel77/iri-playbook/master/upgrade-local-snapshots.sh)

This should get the node configured, download the snapshot meta and state files and restart IRI.

.. note::

  The upgrade script does not support the dockerized version of the iri-playbook


Configure Local Snapshot Settings
---------------------------------
The default values should work fine. Nevertheless, if you would like to configure the settings ``iric`` can be used to edit the configuration file:

Run ``iric`` and select ``n) Configure Files``, then ``b) IRI INI Config``.

Under the line with ``; Local Snapshots Settings`` you will find the settings for local snapshots configuration.
