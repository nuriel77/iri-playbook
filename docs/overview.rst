Using the documentation you will be able to setup a full node on a Linux system (Ubuntu, Debian or CentOS).

The recommended way to install a full node is by using the fully automated installation :ref:`getting_started_quickly`. Please consider using this method rather than the manual method, as it is less error-prone.


The `git repository <https://github.com/nuriel77/iri-playbook>`_ includes all the code of the automated installation using Ansibe Playbook.

The automated installed installs IRI and IOTA peer manager, a web GUI with which you can view your neighbors, add or remove neighbors, view the sync and much more.

In addition, it will install IOTA node monitoring/graphs (grafana).

Here are some screenshots from Chris Holliday's `IOTA Exporter <https://github.com/crholliday/iota-prom-exporter>`_., which is installed by default with this installer:
