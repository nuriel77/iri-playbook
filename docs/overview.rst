Overview
********

This tutorial will help you setup a full node on a Linux system (Ubuntu or CentOS).

I hope to be adding other distributions like Debian in the future.


The `git repository <https://github.com/nuriel77/iri-playbook>`_ I have created includes an automated installation using Ansibe Playbook.

The automated installed installs IRI and IOTA peer manager, a web GUI with which you can view your neighbors, add or remove neighbors, view the sync etc.

In addition, it will install IOTA node monitoring/graphs (grafana).

For help and/or feedback you can create an issue on the git repository, or try to contact me on IOTA's slack (nuriel77).

Here are some screenshots from Chris Holliday's `IOTA Exporter <https://github.com/crholliday/iota-prom-exporter>`_., which is installed by default with this installer:
