.. _remote_access:

Full Node Remote Access
***********************

Update: the recommended way to enable remote access to IRI API port (e.g. for wallets) is via HAProxy. Please refer to :ref:`haproxyEnable`.

1. Exposing IRI Port Externally
===============================
IRI has a command-line argument ("option") ``--remote``. Here's an explanation on what it does:

By default, IRI's API port will listen on the local interface (127.0.0.1). This prevents any external connections to it.


By using the ``--remote`` option, IRI will "listen" on the external interface/IP.

We are going to have to edit the configuration file to enable this option and restart IRI. Follow the next steps.

.. note::

  To edit files you can use ``nano`` which is a simple editor. See :ref:`usingNano` for instructions.


The ``--remote`` option can be specified in the configuration file:

* on **CentOS** ``/etc/sysconfig/iri``
* on **Ubuntu** ``/etc/default/iri``
* on **Debian** ``/etc/default/iri``

Edit the file and find the line:

.. code:: bash

   OPTIONS=""

and add ``--remote`` to it:

.. code:: bash

   OPTIONS="--remote"

Save the file and exit, then restart iri: ``systemctl restart iri``

After IRI initializes, you will see (by issuing ``lsof -Pni|grep java``) that the API port is listening on your external IP.

You can follow the instructions below on how to enable access to the port on the firewall.

.. note::

  By default, this installation is set to **not** allow external communication to this port for security reasons.
  Should you want to allow this, you need to allow the port in the firewall.


Expose IRI API Port in Firewall
-------------------------------

Allowing the port via the playbook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you followed the steps above (enabling the ``--remote`` option in the configuration file) you will need to allow the port in the firewall.

You can do this using the playbook which as a bonus also adds rate limiting.

On **CentOS**::

  cd /opt/iri-playbook && git pull && ansible-playbook -i inventory -v site.yml --tags=iri_firewalld -e api_port_remote=yes

On **Ubuntu/Debian** without rate limiting::

  cd /opt/iri-playbook && git pull && ansible-playbook -i inventory -v site.yml --tags=iri_ufw -e api_port_remote=yes

On **Ubuntu/Debian** with rate limiting::

  cd /opt/iri-playbook && git pull && ansible-playbook -i inventory -v site.yml --tags=iri_ufw -e api_port_remote=yes -e ufw_limit_iri_api=yes

.. note::

  Rate limiting in ubuntu is using ufw which is a very simple wrapper to the iptables firewalls. It only allows one value of max 6 connections per 30 seconds. This might prevent doing PoW on your node if you choose to expose attachToTangle.


Allowing the port manually
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On **CentOS** we run the command (which also adds rate limiting):

.. code:: bash

   firewall-cmd --remove-port=14265/tcp --zone=public --permanent && firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-rich-rule='rule port port="14265" protocol="tcp" limit value=30/m accept' && firewall-cmd --reload



On **Ubuntu/Debian**:

.. code:: bash

   ufw allow 14265/tcp

And to add rate limits:

.. code:: bash

   ufw limit 14265/tcp comment 'IRI API port rate limit'

.. note::

   Rate limiting via ufw on ubuntu is very simple in that it only allows a value of 6 hits per 30 seconds. This can be a problem if you want to enable PoW -- attachToTangle on your node.


Now you should be able to point your (desktop's) light wallet to your server's IP:port (e.g. 80.120.140.100:14265).



.. _tunnelingIriApiForWalletConnections:

2. Tunneling IRI API for Wallet Connection
===========================================

Another option for accessing IRI and/or the iota-pm GUI is to use a SSH tunnel.

SSH tunnel is created within a SSH connection from your computer (desktop/laptop) towards the server.

The benefit here is that you don't have to expose any of the ports or use the ``--remote`` flag. You use SSH to help you tunnel through its connection to the server in order to bind to the ports you need.

.. note::

   For IOTA Peer Manager, this installation has already configured it to be accessible via a webserver.
   See `Peer Manager Behind WebServer with Password`_


What do you need to "forward" the IRI API?

* Your server's IP
* The SSH port (22 by default in which case it doesn't need specifying)
* The port on which IRI API is listening
* The port on which you want to access IRI API on (let's just leave it the same as the one IRI API is listening on)

A default installation would have IRI API listening on TCP port 14265.


.. note::

   In order to create the tunnel you need to run the commands below **from** your laptop/desktop and not on the server where IRI is running.


For Windows desktop/laptop
--------------------------

You can use Putty to create the tunnel/port forward. This can be done for any port on the server. Here we are going to forward the IRI API port from the server to your local machine.

1. Open putty and create a new session name.  Start by entering the node's address and SSH port.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuriel77/iri-playbook/master/docs/images/tunnel_putty_01.png
      :alt: tunnel_putty_01.png

2. On the menu on the left choose 'Tunnels'. Then fill in the Source port and Destination as shown in the image below. The destination is comprised of the IP address and the port. We use 127.0.0.1:14265, as this is by default where we want to forward the port from.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuriel77/iri-playbook/master/docs/images/tunnel_putty_02.png
      :alt: tunnel_putty_02.png

3. Next click 'Add'. You will see that the configuration has been added to the 'Forwarded ports' area.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuriel77/iri-playbook/master/docs/images/tunnel_putty_03.png
         :alt: tunnel_putty_03.png

4. Back in the 'Session' menu, enter a name with which you want to save this configuration/session, last check that the node's address and port are correct, and click 'Save'. The session will be added to the list.

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nuriel77/iri-playbook/master/docs/images/tunnel_putty_04.png
         :alt: tunnel_putty_04.png

5. To open the session and start the port forwarding, all you have to do is to load the session and click 'Open'. To test that the port is being forwarded you can open the browser and point it to ``http://localhost:14265``. This should reply something in the lines of ``error: Invalid API Version``. if this is the case, your API port is being forwarded successfully. You can edit the wallet's node configuration and point it to this address to start using your full node!


For any type of bash command line (Mac/Linux/Windows bash)
----------------------------------------------------------

Here is the tunnel we would have to create (run this on our laptop/desktop)

.. code:: bash

   ssh -p <ssh port> -N -L <iota-pm-port>:localhost:<iota-pm-port> <user-name>@<server-ip>

Which would look like:

.. code:: bash
   
   ssh -p 22 -N -L 14265:localhost:14265 root@<your-server-ip>

Should it ask you for host key verification, reply 'yes'.

Once the command is running you will not see anything, but you can connect with your wallet.
Edit your wallet's "Edit Node Configuration" to point to a custom host and use ``http://localhost:14265`` as address.

To stop the tunnel simply press ``Ctrl-C``.

You can do the same using the IRI API port (14265) and use a light wallet from your desktop to connect to ``http://localhost:14265``.

.. _peerManagerBehindWebServerWithPassword:

Peer Manager Behind WebServer with Password
===========================================

This installation also configured a webserver (nginx) to help access IOTA Peer Manager.
It also locks the page using a password, one which you probably configured earlier during the installation steps.

The IOTA Peer Manager can be accessed if you point your browser to: ``http://your-server-ip:8811``.

.. note::

   The port 8811 will be configured by default unless you changed this before the installation in the variables file.

.. _limitingRemoteCommands:

Limiting Remote Commands
========================

There's an option in the configuration file which works in conjunction with the ``--remote`` option:

.. code:: bash

   REMOTE_LIMIT_API="removeNeighbors, addNeighbors, interruptAttachingToTangle, attachToTangle, getNeighbors"

When connecting to IRI via an external IP these commands will be blocked so that others cannot mess with the node's configuration.

Below we describe how to edit these commands, if necessary.

.. note::

  To edit files you can use ``nano`` which is a simple editor. See :ref:`usingNano` for instructions.


* On **CentOS** edit the file ``/etc/sysconfig/iri``
* On **Ubuntu/Debian** edit the file ``/etc/default/iri``.

This option excludes the commands in it for the remote connection. This is to protect your node.
If you make changes to this option, you will have to **restart IRI**: ``systemctl restart iri``.
