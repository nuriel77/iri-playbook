For a "click-'n-go" installation see :ref:`getting_started_quickly`.

In this installation
====================

* Automate the installation
* Take care of firewalls
* Automatically configure the java memory limit based on your system's RAM
* Explain how to connect a wallet to your full node
* Install IOTA Peer Manager
* Make IOTA Peer Manager accessible via the browser
* Password protect IOTA Peer Manager
* Install monitoring graphs. Big thanks to Chris Holliday's `IOTA Exporter <https://github.com/crholliday/iota-prom-exporter>`_.

Work in progress
================

* Integrate alerting/notifications when node is not healthy
* Instead of compiling IRI, download the jar to expedite the installation a bit
* Security hardening steps
* Make it possible to install graphs for those who already did this installation. At the moment nodejs version will conflict.
